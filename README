Prior to using LiRA, set the LIRA_DIR environmental variable to the absolute path to the downloaded LiRA directory.

At the moment, to run LiRA the input vcf must have been generated using GATK haplotype caller, and must be annotated with 1000 genomes common
allele frequencies in the info field 'DBSNP_CAF.'  In future versions, a LiRA tool will assist with this step.

Dependencies: Bedtools, htslib, samtools, and bcftools.
